# How to Use This Protocol
## A Simple Guide for Learners

---

## What Is This?

A way to learn with AI that makes sure you **really understand**, not just feel like you understand.

**The difference:**

| Normal AI Chat | This Protocol |
|----------------|---------------|
| You ask → AI explains | AI asks → You explain |
| You read and nod | You demonstrate and prove |
| You think you understand | You KNOW you understand |
| You forget in a week | You remember and can use it |

---

## Is This For You?

### ✅ YES, if you:

- Want to actually USE what you learn (not just pass a test)
- Are tired of forgetting everything
- Read tutorials but can't apply them
- Want real understanding, not surface knowledge
- Have 30-60 minutes to learn properly
- Are willing to think hard

### ❌ NO, if you:

- Need to cram for an exam tonight
- Just want quick answers
- Don't plan to apply this knowledge
- Have only 5 minutes
- Don't want to struggle

**Both choices are valid.** This tool is for deep learning. Other tools are for quick answers.

## How It Works (3 Simple Rules)

### Rule 1: AI Asks, You Answer

The AI won't explain first. It will ask what YOU know.

**Example:**
```
Normal AI: "A vector is a list of numbers that..."

This Protocol: "What do you already know about vectors? 
               Where have you seen them?"
```

**Why:** When you explain, you find out what you really know.

---

### Rule 2: Show, Don't Tell

Saying "I understand" is not enough. You must demonstrate.

**Example:**
```
You: "I understand vectors now"

AI: "Good. Explain to me why a song can be 
     represented as a vector. Use your own words."
```

**Why:** If you can't explain it simply, you don't really understand it.

---

### Rule 3: Struggle Is Normal

Feeling stuck is part of learning. The AI will help, but won't give easy answers.

**Example:**
```
You: "I don't know how to answer that"

AI: "That's okay. Let's make it smaller. 
     Just tell me ONE thing you know about this."
```

**Why:** Working through difficulty builds real understanding.

---

## Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose What to Learn

Pick ONE specific thing. Not "machine learning" but "what is a vector."

**Too big:** "Teach me Python"
**Just right:** "How do I read a CSV file in Python?"

---

### Step 2: Copy the Prompt

Click "Get Prompt" tab → Click "Copy" button

---

### Step 3: Paste Into AI

Use any AI chatbot:
- Claude (recommended)
- ChatGPT
- Other AI

Paste the entire prompt, then say what you want to learn.

---

### Step 4: Answer Honestly

The AI will ask about:
- Your energy level (1-5)
- What you already know
- What you're trying to do

**Be honest.** If you're tired, say so. If you know nothing, say so.

---

### Step 5: Learn Through Questions

The AI will guide you with questions. Your job:
- Think before answering
- Use your own words
- Say when you're confused
- Don't pretend to understand

---

## What to Expect

### The First 5 Minutes

AI will ask what you know. You might feel:
- "I don't know anything" → That's okay, say it
- "This is slow" → Yes, but it works
- "Just tell me the answer" → That's not how this works

---

### The Middle

You'll work through the concept by:
- Connecting to things you already know
- Explaining in your own words
- Applying to simple examples
- Getting stuck and working through it

---

### The End

You'll know you're done when you can:
- Explain the concept without help
- Apply it to a new situation
- Know what you still don't understand

---

## If You Get Stuck

### "I don't understand the question"

Say: *"I don't understand what you're asking. Can you ask differently?"*

The AI will try another way.

---

### "I don't know anything about this"

Say: *"I have no background in this. Start from zero."*

The AI will switch to Foundation Mode.

---

### "My brain is tired"

Say: *"I'm tired. Can we stop or make this easier?"*

The AI will either:
- Simplify the questions
- Suggest stopping and continuing later

---

### "I'm frustrated"

This is normal. Say: *"I'm stuck and frustrated."*

The AI will help you find a smaller step forward.

---

## Your Rights as a Learner

You can ALWAYS:

1. **Say "I don't know"** - Honesty is required
2. **Ask for simpler questions** - No shame in this
3. **Use your native language** - If English is hard, switch
4. **Take a break** - Tired brain doesn't learn
5. **Challenge the AI** - If something seems wrong, say so
6. **Stop the session** - You're in control

---

## Tips for Success

### Before the Session

- Have 30-60 minutes
- Energy level 3+ (not exhausted)
- One specific topic in mind
- Quiet place to think

---

### During the Session

- Think before answering
- Use your own words, not textbook words
- Draw or write if it helps
- Say when confused
- Don't rush

---

### After the Session

- Write down what you learned (1-2 sentences)
- Note what's still unclear
- Test yourself tomorrow (do you still remember?)

---

## Example Session

Here's what a real session looks like:

```
YOU: I want to learn what a vector is. I have 30 minutes. 
     Energy is 4.

AI:  Before I explain anything - where have you seen 
     the word "vector" before?

YOU: I've seen it in math class but I don't remember. 
     And in programming sometimes.

AI:  Okay. Let me ask differently. 
     You use Google Maps. When you search for 
     "restaurants near me," how does the app know 
     which restaurants are close to you?

YOU: It knows my location and the restaurant locations?

AI:  Right. And how does a computer store a location?

YOU: Maybe like... coordinates? Like numbers?

AI:  Exactly. A location is stored as two numbers: 
     [latitude, longitude]. Like [24.7136, 46.6753].
     
     This list of numbers IS a vector.
     
     In your own words - what is a vector?

YOU: A vector is a list of numbers that represents something, 
     like a location.

AI:  Good. Now - if locations are vectors, how might the 
     computer find which restaurant is closest to you?

YOU: Compare the numbers somehow?

AI:  How would you compare them? If you're at [24.7, 46.6] 
     and Restaurant A is at [24.8, 46.6] and Restaurant B 
     is at [25.0, 47.0], which is closer?

YOU: A, because the numbers are closer to mine.

AI:  Exactly. You just discovered how similarity works 
     with vectors. Small difference in numbers = similar.
     
     What's one thing you now understand that you 
     didn't before?

YOU: That vectors are just lists of numbers, and similar 
     things have similar numbers.

AI:  Confidence level 1-10?

YOU: 8. I get the basic idea but I'd need practice.

AI:  That's honest and accurate. Good session.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI just explains instead of asking | Remind it: "Please ask me questions, don't explain" |
| Questions are too hard | Say: "This is too hard. Can you start simpler?" |
| I keep saying "I don't know" | That's okay. AI will find what you DO know |
| Session feels too slow | This is normal. Deep learning takes time |
| I'm not sure if I understand | Ask AI: "Can you test me on this?" |
| AI accepted my answer but I'm not sure | Say: "I'm not confident. Can you verify my understanding?" |

---

## After Using This Protocol

### You Should Be Able To:

- Explain the concept in your own words
- Apply it to a situation you haven't seen before
- Know exactly what you still don't understand
- Remember it days later without re-reading

---

### If You Can't Do These Things:

The session wasn't complete. Either:
- Continue in another session
- Ask AI to verify your understanding more
- Practice applying the concept

---

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Pick ONE specific topic
- [ ] Copy the prompt (Get Prompt tab → Copy button)
- [ ] Paste into AI (Claude or ChatGPT)
- [ ] Tell AI your energy level and time available
- [ ] Answer questions honestly
- [ ] Use your own words
- [ ] Say when confused
- [ ] At end: explain what you learned

---

## One Final Thing

**This protocol is harder than normal AI chat.**

That's the point.

Easy learning → Easy forgetting
Hard learning → Real understanding

If it feels like work, it's working.

---

## Questions?

If something in this guide is unclear, the protocol itself will help you understand it. Just paste the prompt and ask:

*"I'm trying to understand how to use this learning protocol. Can you help me?"*
